        "**Regression Table of Adjusted Costs Against Year and U.S. Population:** The p-value for year is equal to 0.300 and the p-value for U.S. Population is equal to 0.242. Since both variables are greater than 0.05, they are not statistically significant when included together. Since neither predictor is significant when both are in the model, this could suggest multicollinearity meaning that the variables are highly correlated (since both increase over time), making it hard to distinguish their individual effects."

        "**Apparent Conflict:** Yes, there seems to be an apparent conflict. In the first two regression models, year and U.S. Population each appeared to be significant predictors on their own, however, when combined in the third regression model, neither remained significant. As stated briefly before, this conflict likely arises due to multicollinearity since both year and U.S. Population are strongly related (since they both increase over time). Due to this, their individual contributions to predicting hurricane damage costs are not distinguishable when included in the same model. This is further supported by the very large condition number of 2.85e+06 in the third regression model, which signals multicollinearity issues. In conclusion, both year and U.S. Population are significant individual predictors of adjusted hurricane damage costs. However, when included together in the same regression model, neither one remains significant, which is an indicator of multicollinearity issues. This suggests that while each variable is associated with damage cost increases, their strong correlation prevents clear seperation of their effects in a combined model."
