        "Yes, the response variable, the annual $CO_2$ emmisions per capita, is changing **significantly** as a function of the explanatory variable, the GDP per capita. This conclusion can be made due to three specific values from the regression tables. First, the p-value for the GDP per capita coefficient is very small (equal to 0.000) and is far below the standard significance level of 0.05. This means that the relationship between the GDP per capita and the annual $CO_2$ emissions per capita is statistically significant. It also indicates that there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the slppe is zero. Due to this, it can be confidently said that there is a linear relationship. Second, the slope of the regression line is about 0.0002. This means that for every \\$1 increase in GDP per capita, the annual $CO_2$ emmisions per capita increase by 0.0002 metric tons. Since this is a positive value, it indicates that there is a direct relationship between the two variables. Finally, the $R^2$ value is about 0.621. This means that about 62.1% of the variation in annual $CO_2$ emissions per capita can be explained by GDP per capita. It also indicates that the model fits the data reasonably well. When put together, these values show that the model is statistically significant and that the GDP per capita is a meaningful predictor of annual $CO_2$ emmissionas per capita."
